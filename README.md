# x-stitch

Work in progress! Aim is to have an end to end pipeline that takes an image and some parameters to return a cross stitch pattern.  

So far, the script will run from terminal to return a pattern-looking thing. So it looks like we are close... 
Things I will do (but haven't done yet):

 - Add symbols to the pattern to identify each color
 - Add a key to the pattern to identify each symbol:color pair
 - Return the output as a pdf
 - Slap a GUI in front of the script (streamlit looks promising for this)
